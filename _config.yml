  Hey everyone! I am Jay Mistry, a sophomore at IIIT Vadodara. I got into coding a bit early in
  my life, and am loving it since then! I love learning new stuff, and building things that help
  out me, and others. I believe in building a solution, rather than finding it someplace else. You
  can know more about me on one of my social handles. Thanks for visiting!
