### Origin Story Time :P

I coined the word "RossoSkull" when I was studying in 12<sup>th</sup> class. I was frequently playing computer games then, so I needed a "cool" name which I could use in those games. And _"Rossoskull"_ came to my mind. _Rossoskull_ is comprised of two seperate terms - _Rosso_ and _Skull_. As a whole, _RossoSkull_ means _RedSkull_.

I used to play a lot of Assassin's Creed titles back then ( During my 12<sup>th</sup> class ). Assassin's Creed is one of my most favourite gaming franchises. Anyone who played AC:2, AC:Brotherhood, and AC:Revelation, would know Ezio Auditore. Out of all the AC characters, he is my favourite. And he was Italian. I got acquainted with Italian language due to Ezio, and I started to like it. And _Rosso_ means _Red_ in Italian.

So I took _Rosso_ from Italian language, and joined it to _Skull_, and got _"RossoSkull"_ - meaning _RedSkull_. RedSkull is a the name of a villain in the Marvel Universe, who first appeared in _Captain America : The First Avenger_, and then in _Avengers : Infinity War_. I am not particularly a fan of Redskull, but _RossoSkull_ clicked my mind, I started to like that name.

So, I started using it. The word was unique, so it was available everywhere - GitHub, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. Also this domain `rossoskull.me` was available. So, it was very convenient for me to use this word as my username, as no one else was using it, I didn't need to add numbers or underscores around it to use it ( e.g. rossoskull123,  \_rossoskull\_, etc. ).

And so came the name _"RossoSkull"_. I'll wrap it here.

Adios Folks!
