### First Ever Blog Post!
Hey everyone! I am Jay Mistry, a Sophomore at IIIT Vadodara. This is my first ever blog post! I am very excited regarding this blog `rossoskull.me`, because now I have a tool, that's under my control, using which I will share some ( or many ) of the cool stuff that happens in my life. Hopefully, these blog posts will be helpful to some of you in one way or the other.

To know more about me, you can go [here](/about/). Also to get more updates about this blog, or from my life, you can follow me on various social medias.

### About This Blog
This blog is created using [Jekyll][jekyll-docs], which is a tool that helps you create simple, blog-aware static sites! Sounds cool, doesn't it? Guess what, it actually is. This site is hosted using [Github Pages][gh-pages], and that too - for free! GitHub Pages supports Jekyll. I'll be sharing my experiences and some stuff about coding using this blog.
